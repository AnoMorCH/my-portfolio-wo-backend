              The project was created to help a community to choose their leader
              using a demorcratic poll system. All users are divided by groups,
              and they can vote for people and participate in an election.

              Also there are moderators who can control the whole process. The

                I have a back-end background. I have worked with Django and
                Flask. I am pretty confident with all simple components of
                back-end development like creating an authorization system,
                changing the content of a database by frontend activity,
                payments system etc. Also I am ready to learn any new framework
                which you believe is suitable for your project.

                I am good with these guys too. However, for me, the front-end is
                just like a hobby which helps me relax after hard back-end work.
                In spite of that, I can do a lot of tasks which many front-end
                programmers do like building a layout, creating vanilla
                animations, writing styles for a project and a lot of other
                things. Also, I am nice with adaptice layout.

                I believe today everything which is written in the back-end
                should be tested thoroughly. So, I cover every project with
                tests by 100 percent. Sometimes I write them too much but I
                think being a testing freak is better than not writing tests at
                all.

                I have a lot of other qualities which are helpful in IT. I have
                a nice experience with Docker, AWS, Robocassa, Heroku, git
                system, Linux and a lot of other stuff. Also I am a confident
                English speaker and prefer writing all which is connected with
                code only in the language. As a person, I am friendly,
